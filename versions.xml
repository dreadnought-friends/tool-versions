<![CDATA[Do you experience one or more of the following issues?
* in-game chat not working and/or gradually getting worse for users
* disconnection from server
* slate crash during transition into match (infinite loading)
* client locking mid match, yet the audio still persists as if the match is still being played
* not being given the option to rejoin matches
* spawning under the map

The development team asked us to provide your region, internet speed and the files this tool collects to the support group as they are having a team working on those issues RIGHT now!]]>
