Help QA Track Down This Bug!
Nafie is looking for logs relating to a bug that causes the game to hang when both teams are close to winning (96/96, etc) and players either receive a crash or are booted back to hangar unexpectedly, completely skipping the end of match screen.

If you are experiencing this bug please contact DN_Nafie#5673 (Discord) to send her your logs!
