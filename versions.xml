Hello Captains! An incoming transmission from DN_Nafie, you can reach her on Discord.

I'm sending out a request for players to send me client logs and number of occurences for attempts that players try to connect to a match (and subsequently crash/disconnect/get kicked back to hangar).

When you message me your logs, please note:
- What was the estimated time that your issue occurred?
- Where were you in the game when this occurred? (Loading screen, orbit, in match, hangar, etc.)
- What is your geographical location? (Country is fine!)
- How many times did this issue occur?

END TRANSMISSION.

1.8.1 is released: https://www.greybox.com/dreadnought/en/news/pc-patch-181-balance-changes-and-big-rebel-yell/
